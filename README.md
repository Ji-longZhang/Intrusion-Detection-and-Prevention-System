# Intrusion Detection and Prevention System
A web application for detecting and preventing intrusions in multitier web applications and validate the algorithm using DemoWeb application and UnSafeApp application.

### We Provide a secure way to implement web application to detect and prevent following attacks:–

  * Privilege Escalation Attack
  * SQL Injection Attack
  * Direct Database Attack
  * Session Hijack Attack
  * Denial of Service Attack

### IDPS Features:-
1. Server on which Applications reside is a separate one from the server where IDPS resides, hence it won’t affect the speed of the application.
2. The control logic in the host controller selects the web server to satisfy the web requests. Hence selection of  a web server  with minimal pending requests can be made and hence processing of the system speeds up.
3. A separate log file is maintained with the intrusion details, the type of attack, culprit’s IP address, date and time of the attack for future references.
4. Real time detection, prevention and reporting.
