# Intrusion Detection and Prevention System
A web application for detecting and preventing intrusions in multitier web applications and validate the algorithm using DemoWeb application and UnSafeApp application.

### We Provide a secure way to implement web application to detect and prevent following attacks:–

  1. Privilege Escalation Attack
  2. SQL Injection Attack
  3. Direct Database Attack
  4. Session Hijack Attack

### IDPS Features:-
* Server on which Applications reside is a separate one from the server where IDPS resides, hence it won’t affect the speed of the application.
* The control logic in the host controller selects the web server to satisfy the web requests. Hence selection of  a web server  with minimal pending requests can be made and hence processing of the system speeds up.
* A separate log file is maintained with the intrusion details, the type of attack, culprit’s IP address, date and time of the attack for future references.
* Real time detection, prevention and reporting.
